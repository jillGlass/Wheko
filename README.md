# Welcome to Wheko

This is my version of He Pokai Manu, the bird spotting app that I built as part of a team of four as our final project at Dev Academy.

I have changed the structure of the app, instead of finding one bird of each species, you can now spot a species multiple times and it will be counted, as well as each species.

I built this with bootstrap instead of semantic ui, changing css frameworks to learn something new.

Built in React JS.
